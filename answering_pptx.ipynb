            "[\"Root Cause AnalysisAgendaRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) offers systematic analysis and resolution of incidents for a distributed mission critical customer environment. All tools are safe: they do not allow changes when used by SAP employees unless explicitly requested by the customer and enforced by the customer change management process.

An administrator can assign an authorization area to a folder. Then only users that have an authorization for authorization object Solution Documentation (SM_SDOC) with this authorization area name in the field Authorization Area (SMUDAREA) for this authorization area are allowed to perform activities for this folder and its sub elements.Authorization areas are defined solution-specific. An authorization area has a 30 character long technical name and a description. The default authorization area does not need to be defined. The Solution Documentation root element and all elements without assignment have the implicit authorization area assignment Default by definition.When no authorization areas have been assigned to the elements of a solution yet, every element has authorization area Default. The assignment of a structure element to an authorization area is valid for all branches of a solution in which the assigned elements exists. The authorization area explicitly assigned to a structure element is valid for the whole subtree rooted by the element excluding all subtrees rooted by elements with own authorization area assignments. Non-structure elements always inherit the authorization area from their structure parents. The authorization area determination is branch-specific as the inheritance hierarchy is branch specific: if an element is moved between two folders that have different areas assigned, it may inherit a new authorization area from the new parent folder, so in this case the authorization area of an element may differ in different branches.Authorization AreaToday in Jera Solution Documentation two SAP Best Practices uploaded as below:SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA (on promise) (S4HANA2020 - JP)SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA (on promise) (S4HANA2020 - US)The idea is to segregate the access to each Solution documentation between JAM users and JAPAN users.To do that the authorization Object SM_SDOC is used, value Authorization Area.Jera ScenarioCreate 2 Authorization Area as below:BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JAMBP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JAPANCreate 2 new roles copy of SAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY --> For DisplayZSAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY_US (SM_SDOC : Authorization Area = BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_US)ZSAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY_JP\\xa0\\xa0(SM_SDOC : Authorization Area = BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JP)Do the same for below roles:SAP_SM_SL_ADMINSAP_SM_SL_EDITSAP_SM_SL_EDIT_BPMNApproachCreate 2 new roles copy of ZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP --> For DeveloperZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP_US (include new single roles *US)ZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP_JP  (include new single roles *JP)Do the same for above composite roles.ZSAP_OST_FB_ARCHITECT_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_BPE_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_OWNER_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_PM_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_UAT_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_CHANGE_M_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_CHANGE_R_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_REL_M_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_TESTER_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_TEST_M_COMPAssign new composite roles to user instead of current assigned roles.ApproachFor users with *JP roles the result in Soldoc will be as below:ResultFor users with *US roles the result in Soldoc will be as below:Result', 'Root Cause AnalysisAgendaRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) offers systematic analysis and resolution of incidents for a distributed mission critical customer environment. All tools are safe: they do not allow changes when used by SAP employees unless explicitly requested by the customer and enforced by the customer change management process. Furthermore, this approach must be supported by tools that help customers do this as efficiently as possible, following SAP Best Practices. OverviewMotivationEvery customer has mission-critical applications along with integration needs.SAP landscapes become more sophisticated the more comprehensive & integrated they are.End-to-End Root Cause Analysis contains at least out of four cross-component capabilities for analysis activities to be conducted on the managing system (cross-component analysis activities) and analysis activities to be conducted on the managed system (single-component analysis activities).The aim of root cause analysis (RCA) is fast problem resolution. End-to-End (E2E) means from the client through network to application servers and databases, and back. The four main tools are as follows:Cross-component capabilities The goal of end-to-end workload analysis is to provide access to statistical performance data for different systems.Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 1/2Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 2/2This figure shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here you can get a good overview of the workload in your solution for the chosen time frame. You can change the granularity from hourly to dailyWithin the ABAP Basis Workload Summary view, you can check for general performance problems affecting all transactions.The goal of end-to-end exception analysis is to easily and efficiently identify the most frequenterrors and the applications that are causing them.Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 1/2Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 2/2The figure, End-to-End Exception Analysis - Overview, shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here, you get a good overview of the exceptions in your solution for the chosen time frame.The ABAP SysLog Errors view is divided into different sections:Overall Result: The upper section displays a summary across all ABAP instances belonging to the selected system. You can drill down into the view by right-clicking.Select Instance: The lower section contains instance specific data. You can select individual instances with the dropdown list.Metric Data Display: The Jump-In feature is only available for the instance specific view. In this case, you can jump into transaction SM21 for further analysis. The following table shows all Jump-In functionalities, sorted by exception class.The goal of E2E change analysis is to provide a top-down view of the configuration parametersand software (configuration items) changes of the managed systems.Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 1/2Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 2/2The change analysis opens an Overview tab, and an additional tab is created for each product instance of the selected system(s) and for the hosts.The most common use case of the trace analysis tools is to identify user requests within a complex system landscape that have an excessive execution time.It includes analysis features across the complete solution landscape, so that a component causing a problem can be isolated and the root cause can be identified.Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 1/2Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 2/2If you want to enable a trace you first need to select the system, you want to trace for. To do this, use the Scope icon. Select all systems you want to trace, then choose Ok. Select the Trace Enabling viewChoose Enable all. The State icon indicates if the trace could be successfully enabled. DEMORoot Cause AnalysisSystem Analysis:\\xa0In case of non-ABAP based systems, the CA transaction trace can be used to identify which part of a request e.g., in a Java environment caused the problem. CA Introscope is shipped by SAP with preconfigured dash boards, offering dedicated views for the ABAP and non-ABAP based systems. A deep analysis of problems is possible in the investigator mode, which displays detailed performance metrics. Several other system analysis tools as Thread Dump Analysis, Change Reporting and Central Log Viewer are provided.Configuration Validation:\\xa0Configuration validation determines whether the systems in your landscape are configured consistently and in accordance with your company\\'s requirements. You validate the current configuration of a system in your SAP landscape by comparing it with a target state (system) or an existing system.Host Analysis:\\xa0With the Host Analysis section of the RCA Work Center, it is possible to analyze the most important OS metrics like CPU, memory, paging, network and disk/file system. In addition, the file system browser allows a central read-only access to predefined directories on the managed system without having to logon to the console of the managed system. In the same manner it is also possible with the OS Command Console, to execute predefined, non-destructible commands (like a ping, netstat, iostat and so on). Both tools ensure that even whilst access to the managed system is granted, no change can be made, no business data can be accessed, and not harmful commands can be executed.Database Analysis:\\xa0The DB Analysis summarizes DB Performance Warehouse specific metrics across all supported DB types.

The end-to-end cross-component tracing aims to decrease the time for gathering the relevant trace data related to a single user activity and simplifies the analysis by guiding the user through the analysis steps and identifying the component which consumes the biggest amount of the total execution time. In addition, it is possible to find exceptions which were triggered by the request in one of the connected components.OverviewAfter the trace has been created, SAP Solution Manager collects all the trace data from all systems and displays the results broken down per step in an overview screen.User experience monitoring setup consists of three technical steps:PreparationRecording the script (Http/Https or GUI Scripts)Deploying the script on robots (Diagnostic Agent)Data CollectionSetup GuidePreparation:Perform Solution Manager mandatory configurationIdentify scenarios for scriptingIdentify diagnostic agents at global locations to be used as robotsIdentify monitoring parameters and thresholds for alerting123Specify exact end user scenario to be scripted: The user scenario documentation is one of the most important steps during  an EEMon Project. It should be regarded as roll-in process where the business users explain a user scenario in detail and provide a well-defined click-sequence through the relevant scenarios.To avoid unnecessary complexity in the scenarios the documentation step should be performed together with Application Operations team to reflect EEMon limitations and opportunities.

All tools are safe: they do not allow changes when used by SAP employees unless explicitly requested by the customer and enforced by the customer change management process. Furthermore, this approach must be supported by tools that help customers do this as efficiently as possible, following SAP Best Practices. OverviewMotivationEvery customer has mission-critical applications along with integration needs.SAP landscapes become more sophisticated the more comprehensive & integrated they are.End-to-End Root Cause Analysis contains at least out of four cross-component capabilities for analysis activities to be conducted on the managing system (cross-component analysis activities) and analysis activities to be conducted on the managed system (single-component analysis activities).The aim of root cause analysis (RCA) is fast problem resolution. End-to-End (E2E) means from the client through network to application servers and databases, and back. The four main tools are as follows:Cross-component capabilities The goal of end-to-end workload analysis is to provide access to statistical performance data for different systems.Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 1/2Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 2/2This figure shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here you can get a good overview of the workload in your solution for the chosen time frame. You can change the granularity from hourly to dailyWithin the ABAP Basis Workload Summary view, you can check for general performance problems affecting all transactions.The goal of end-to-end exception analysis is to easily and efficiently identify the most frequenterrors and the applications that are causing them.Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 1/2Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 2/2The figure, End-to-End Exception Analysis - Overview, shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here, you get a good overview of the exceptions in your solution for the chosen time frame.The ABAP SysLog Errors view is divided into different sections:Overall Result: The upper section displays a summary across all ABAP instances belonging to the selected system. You can drill down into the view by right-clicking.Select Instance: The lower section contains instance specific data. You can select individual instances with the dropdown list.Metric Data Display: The Jump-In feature is only available for the instance specific view. In this case, you can jump into transaction SM21 for further analysis. The following table shows all Jump-In functionalities, sorted by exception class.The goal of E2E change analysis is to provide a top-down view of the configuration parametersand software (configuration items) changes of the managed systems.Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 1/2Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 2/2The change analysis opens an Overview tab, and an additional tab is created for each product instance of the selected system(s) and for the hosts.The most common use case of the trace analysis tools is to identify user requests within a complex system landscape that have an excessive execution time.It includes analysis features across the complete solution landscape, so that a component causing a problem can be isolated and the root cause can be identified.Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 1/2Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 2/2If you want to enable a trace you first need to select the system, you want to trace for.

SAP Business Process Operations comprises the following processes: Business process monitoring Business process improvementJob management and job monitoringData consistency managementBusiness Process OperationsData Consistency Management in Solution Manager comprises the tools and procedures required to prevent, detect, investigate and correct inconsistencies in your solution landscape. This helps to ensure the successful execution of your core business processes and prevents costly business process downtimes.Today\\'s business processes evolve in complex structures involving several systems of the overall landscape. As shown in the picture below it is important to ensure the data consistency between all involved systems.Data Consistency ManagementOverview & MotivationApart from user level errors like an incorrect manual entry in the system, there are possibilities of inconsistencies as well on application and technology level. The next slide presents potential causes of data inconsistency.Is the data exchanged between the systems as well as the data needed for correct operation of the business process consistent?Data Consistency ManagementWhy can Data Inconsistencies Occur?ExamplesDatabase Crash at a customer and last backup ~12 months old. Which business documents/areas are affected?Inconsistencies between MM and FI during goods movements with unknown Root Cause. What is the root cause?A custom-made report has accidentally deleted parts of business objects. Which objects are affected?Some data has been replicated multiple times between two systemsInconsistent data storage in multiple systems using sRFC/HTTP within one business step. What data arrived where?Many IDoc errors between ECC and WM. Is there an interface error that affects my most important business partner?Data Consistency ManagementWhy can Data Inconsistencies Occur?Global transparency across organizational units & process variants through increase visibility of current data quality and consistency state.Reduced operating costs through automating data consistency management and reduce manual process inefficiencies and human errors. Avoid systematic process exceptions.Higher customer satisfaction & faster revenue stream by avoiding delayed business documents and financial losses by quick reaction to interface errors affecting data of core business processes.More accurate business reporting by avoiding inaccurate reporting data by ensuring consistency between systems and quicker clean up due to earlier detectionData Consistency ManagementBenefitsSolution Manager includes several tools to cover the Data Consistency Management cycle and different technologies.Data Consistency ManagementToolsData Consistency ManagementData Consistency Management Launchpad GroupData Consistency ManagementData Consistency Management Launchpad GroupDEMOData Consistency Management', 'Root Cause AnalysisAgendaRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) offers systematic analysis and resolution of incidents for a distributed mission critical customer environment. All tools are safe: they do not allow changes when used by SAP employees unless explicitly requested by the customer and enforced by the customer change management process. Furthermore, this approach must be supported by tools that help customers do this as efficiently as possible, following SAP Best Practices. OverviewMotivationEvery customer has mission-critical applications along with integration needs.SAP landscapes become more sophisticated the more comprehensive & integrated they are.End-to-End Root Cause Analysis contains at least out of four cross-component capabilities for analysis activities to be conducted on the managing system (cross-component analysis activities) and analysis activities to be conducted on the managed system (single-component analysis activities).The aim of root cause analysis (RCA) is fast problem resolution. End-to-End (E2E) means from the client through network to application servers and databases, and back. The four main tools are as follows:Cross-component capabilities The goal of end-to-end workload analysis is to provide access to statistical performance data for different systems.Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 1/2Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 2/2This figure shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here you can get a good overview of the workload in your solution for the chosen time frame. You can change the granularity from hourly to dailyWithin the ABAP Basis Workload Summary view, you can check for general performance problems affecting all transactions.The goal of end-to-end exception analysis is to easily and efficiently identify the most frequenterrors and the applications that are causing them.Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 1/2Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 2/2The figure, End-to-End Exception Analysis - Overview, shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here, you get a good overview of the exceptions in your solution for the chosen time frame.The ABAP SysLog Errors view is divided into different sections:Overall Result: The upper section displays a summary across all ABAP instances belonging to the selected system. You can drill down into the view by right-clicking.Select Instance: The lower section contains instance specific data. You can select individual instances with the dropdown list.Metric Data Display: The Jump-In feature is only available for the instance specific view. In this case, you can jump into transaction SM21 for further analysis. The following table shows all Jump-In functionalities, sorted by exception class.The goal of E2E change analysis is to provide a top-down view of the configuration parametersand software (configuration items) changes of the managed systems.Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 1/2Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 2/2The change analysis opens an Overview tab, and an additional tab is created for each product instance of the selected system(s) and for the hosts.The most common use case of the trace analysis tools is to identify user requests within a complex system landscape that have an excessive execution time.It includes analysis features across the complete solution landscape, so that a component causing a problem can be isolated and the root cause can be identified.Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 1/2Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 2/2If you want to enable a trace you first need to select the system, you want to trace for. To do this, use the Scope icon. Select all systems you want to trace, then choose Ok. Select the Trace Enabling viewChoose Enable all. The State icon indicates if the trace could be successfully enabled. DEMORoot Cause AnalysisSystem Analysis:\\xa0In case of non-ABAP based systems, the CA transaction trace can be used to identify which part of a request e.g., in a Java environment caused the problem. CA Introscope is shipped by SAP with preconfigured dash boards, offering dedicated views for the ABAP and non-ABAP based systems. A deep analysis of problems is possible in the investigator mode, which displays detailed performance metrics. Several other system analysis tools as Thread Dump Analysis, Change Reporting and Central Log Viewer are provided.Configuration Validation:\\xa0Configuration validation determines whether the systems in your landscape are configured consistently and in accordance with your company\\'s requirements. You validate the current configuration of a system in your SAP landscape by comparing it with a target state (system) or an existing system.Host Analysis:\\xa0With the Host Analysis section of the RCA Work Center, it is possible to analyze the most important OS metrics like CPU, memory, paging, network and disk/file system. In addition, the file system browser allows a central read-only access to predefined directories on the managed system without having to logon to the console of the managed system. In the same manner it is also possible with the OS Command Console, to execute predefined, non-destructible commands (like a ping, netstat, iostat and so on). Both tools ensure that even whilst access to the managed system is granted, no change can be made, no business data can be accessed, and not harmful commands can be executed.Database Analysis:\\xa0The DB Analysis summarizes DB Performance Warehouse specific metrics across all supported DB types. This also includes standalone DB\\'s that are connected to the DBA Cockpit within Solution ManagerAppendixBusiness Process OperationsBusiness Process ImprovementAgendaSAP Business Process Operations comprises the most important application-related operations topics to ensure the smooth and reliable flow of the core business processes, to meet a company’s business requirements.

An administrator can assign an authorization area to a folder. Then only users that have an authorization for authorization object Solution Documentation (SM_SDOC) with this authorization area name in the field Authorization Area (SMUDAREA) for this authorization area are allowed to perform activities for this folder and its sub elements.Authorization areas are defined solution-specific. An authorization area has a 30 character long technical name and a description. The default authorization area does not need to be defined. The Solution Documentation root element and all elements without assignment have the implicit authorization area assignment Default by definition.When no authorization areas have been assigned to the elements of a solution yet, every element has authorization area Default. The assignment of a structure element to an authorization area is valid for all branches of a solution in which the assigned elements exists. The authorization area explicitly assigned to a structure element is valid for the whole subtree rooted by the element excluding all subtrees rooted by elements with own authorization area assignments. Non-structure elements always inherit the authorization area from their structure parents. The authorization area determination is branch-specific as the inheritance hierarchy is branch specific: if an element is moved between two folders that have different areas assigned, it may inherit a new authorization area from the new parent folder, so in this case the authorization area of an element may differ in different branches.Authorization AreaToday in Jera Solution Documentation two SAP Best Practices uploaded as below:SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA (on promise) (S4HANA2020 - JP)SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA (on promise) (S4HANA2020 - US)The idea is to segregate the access to each Solution documentation between JAM users and JAPAN users.To do that the authorization Object SM_SDOC is used, value Authorization Area.Jera ScenarioCreate 2 Authorization Area as below:BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JAMBP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JAPANCreate 2 new roles copy of SAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY --> For DisplayZSAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY_US (SM_SDOC : Authorization Area = BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_US)ZSAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY_JP\\xa0\\xa0(SM_SDOC : Authorization Area = BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JP)Do the same for below roles:SAP_SM_SL_ADMINSAP_SM_SL_EDITSAP_SM_SL_EDIT_BPMNApproachCreate 2 new roles copy of ZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP --> For DeveloperZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP_US (include new single roles *US)ZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP_JP  (include new single roles *JP)Do the same for above composite roles.ZSAP_OST_FB_ARCHITECT_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_BPE_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_OWNER_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_PM_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_UAT_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_CHANGE_M_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_CHANGE_R_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_REL_M_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_TESTER_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_TEST_M_COMPAssign new composite roles to user instead of current assigned roles.ApproachFor users with *JP roles the result in Soldoc will be as below:ResultFor users with *US roles the result in Soldoc will be as below:ResultApplication OperationsUser Experience MonitoringAgendaThe analysis of performance and functional problems in such a complex landscape is time consuming and requires expert knowledge.

SAP Business Process Operations comprises the following processes: Business process monitoring Business process improvementJob management and job monitoringData consistency managementBusiness Process OperationsData Consistency Management in Solution Manager comprises the tools and procedures required to prevent, detect, investigate and correct inconsistencies in your solution landscape. This helps to ensure the successful execution of your core business processes and prevents costly business process downtimes.Today\\'s business processes evolve in complex structures involving several systems of the overall landscape. As shown in the picture below it is important to ensure the data consistency between all involved systems.Data Consistency ManagementOverview & MotivationApart from user level errors like an incorrect manual entry in the system, there are possibilities of inconsistencies as well on application and technology level. The next slide presents potential causes of data inconsistency.Is the data exchanged between the systems as well as the data needed for correct operation of the business process consistent?Data Consistency ManagementWhy can Data Inconsistencies Occur?ExamplesDatabase Crash at a customer and last backup ~12 months old. Which business documents/areas are affected?Inconsistencies between MM and FI during goods movements with unknown Root Cause. What is the root cause?A custom-made report has accidentally deleted parts of business objects. Which objects are affected?Some data has been replicated multiple times between two systemsInconsistent data storage in multiple systems using sRFC/HTTP within one business step. What data arrived where?Many IDoc errors between ECC and WM. Is there an interface error that affects my most important business partner?Data Consistency ManagementWhy can Data Inconsistencies Occur?Global transparency across organizational units & process variants through increase visibility of current data quality and consistency state.Reduced operating costs through automating data consistency management and reduce manual process inefficiencies and human errors. Avoid systematic process exceptions.Higher customer satisfaction & faster revenue stream by avoiding delayed business documents and financial losses by quick reaction to interface errors affecting data of core business processes.More accurate business reporting by avoiding inaccurate reporting data by ensuring consistency between systems and quicker clean up due to earlier detectionData Consistency ManagementBenefitsSolution Manager includes several tools to cover the Data Consistency Management cycle and different technologies.Data Consistency ManagementToolsData Consistency ManagementData Consistency Management Launchpad GroupData Consistency ManagementData Consistency Management Launchpad GroupDEMOData Consistency ManagementApplication OperationsIntegration MonitoringAgendaIntegration Monitoring focuses on monitoring of communications between business-critical systems within the on-premise landscape at customer side as well as on communications with business partners and SAP cloud products.It covers peer-to-peer communications, communications via integration components as well as the status of the SAP based integration components itself in terms of availability, performance and exceptions.OverviewAll systems are connected to SAP Solution Manager and system monitoring is enabled Configuration of Integration Monitoring is supported by guided procedures Results are collected centrally in SAP Solution ManagerMonitoring StrategyPossibility to check the overall status of multiple PI Domains in one screenCentral status monitoring for all PI component Monitoring of PI Message Flows down to single instancesVisualization of different interface types including sufficient monitoring and alerting for performance, usage, availability and exceptions As a part of Integration Monitoring, Interface and Connection Monitoring (ICMon) in SAP Solution Manager provides you with a powerful tool to monitor various interface technologies within your landscape.To use Interface Monitoring, connect to Solution Manager Launchpad > Group “System and Application Monitoring” > Tile “Interface Monitoring”Interface & Connection MonitoringInterface & Connection Monitoring1234Click Go to see available technical scenariosActivate technical scenario checkboxClick OkInterface & Connection MonitoringThe infrastructure configuration must be done whenever you want to use interface and connection monitoring. It can only be accessed via transaction SOLMAN_SETUP --> Application Operations --> Integration Monitoring --> Interfaces and Connections. The Setup itself consists of several steps which are executed as a Guided Procedure. Each step contains a help section as well as a logging area.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureSeveral Configuration Steps are necessary in order to prepare the Monitoring and Alerting Infrastructure. Most of these steps are common for all Monitoring use cases.Standard Users (optional):In this optional step, you can create the standard Level 1 and Level 2 Interface and Connection Monitoring Template/Demo Users in the SAP Solution Manager system. When you create a template user, the system assigns roles and authorizations automatically.The level 1 user can distribute problems in the Alert Inbox, to other users. Besides the ICMon UI he can access the Alert overview monitor and can create notifications/incidents.The level 2 user has all authorization of the level 1 user plus additional permissions to act as the second level support for certain problems. He can work in the Alert Inbox and performance Root Cause Analysis activities in order to process relevant problems.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureDefine Scope:The first step in the interface channel monitoring setup with Interface and Connection Monitoring is the creation of an Interface and Connection Monitoring scenario. Without selecting a scenario, you cannot proceed to the next setup steps. A scenario is a set of technical systems and/or hosts.Monitoring & Alerting Setup:Preparation:Select Scenario Attributes (Optional)In order to tag an Interface Channel, so-called Interface Channel Attributes can be used. These tags can be used to assign e.g. business process information to the channel, to make it easier to understand the impact of a technical interface channel to business.Click on the ICMON Attribute Assignment linkSelect the attributes you want to use for this scenario or create new onesSave your work Activate Web Service Monitoring (Optional)If you want to monitor synchronous web service calls regarding performance and number of executions of your ABAP system, you first need to activate local Web Service Monitoring in the managed system.EEM Script ConfigurationYou can create UXMon (User Experience Monitoring) scripts to monitor the availability of your interfaces with synthetic load.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureActivate SAP MII MonitoringIf you have an SAP MII (Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence) in your landscape, you can use Interface and Connection Monitoring to monitor the SAP MII data servers.Schedule ExtractorsIn this activity extractors are scheduled which are relevant for collecting the information from the managed ABAP system. You can find these extractors in the EFWK under the setup type IC_MON.Load ST-A/PI Meta Data from Managed SystemSome of the data collectors we use for interface monitoring on the ABAP system are historically shipped with ST-A/PI and their availability depends on the ST-A/PI version installed on the managed system. To know which monitors are available for each managed ABAP system you need to download the meta data information for the monitors from the ABAP system.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureConfiguration:In the next step you can now either create a new Interface Channel, or you can assign or copy an existing one. You can also delete or un-assign channels.Assign existing Channels:If you want to assign an already existing channel to your scenario switch to the view \"All relevant channels\" and all available channels will appear. Select the channel you want to assign and click the \"Assign\" button. You don\\'t have to change anything in the channel.Create a new Channel:To create a new Interface Channel, click the \"Create\" button. In the emerging window you now enter the channel name, the channel type and select a monitoring template depending on the type. In the next step you enter the source and the target system. If your source/target system is a technical system or an external service in the landscape added to this scenario, then you can select it from the drop-down list.If you have selected a channel type that can be measured in source or target system, and you have selected source and target systems that both support the measurement (e.g. both ABAP systems for IDoc channels) you can also select the measuring point in this step.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureActivation:Once you have set all thresholds and data collection period you can activate the interface monitoring. You have different options to activate the interfaces.All Interface ChannelsSelected Interface Channels onlyAll changed Interface channelsSelected Interface Channels (in Dialog Mode) Select the one that suits you best.The activation takes place in a background job, except you select the dialog mode activation. A progress bar shows the status of the background job.Deactivation:If necessary, you can also deactivate all or single interfaces.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureDEMOIntegration Monitoring', 'Root Cause AnalysisAgendaRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) offers systematic analysis and resolution of incidents for a distributed mission critical customer environment. All tools are safe: they do not allow changes when used by SAP employees unless explicitly requested by the customer and enforced by the customer change management process. Furthermore, this approach must be supported by tools that help customers do this as efficiently as possible, following SAP Best Practices. OverviewMotivationEvery customer has mission-critical applications along with integration needs.SAP landscapes become more sophisticated the more comprehensive & integrated they are.End-to-End Root Cause Analysis contains at least out of four cross-component capabilities for analysis activities to be conducted on the managing system (cross-component analysis activities) and analysis activities to be conducted on the managed system (single-component analysis activities).The aim of root cause analysis (RCA) is fast problem resolution. End-to-End (E2E) means from the client through network to application servers and databases, and back. The four main tools are as follows:Cross-component capabilities The goal of end-to-end workload analysis is to provide access to statistical performance data for different systems.Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 1/2Using End-to-End Workload Analysis (WA) 2/2This figure shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here you can get a good overview of the workload in your solution for the chosen time frame. You can change the granularity from hourly to dailyWithin the ABAP Basis Workload Summary view, you can check for general performance problems affecting all transactions.The goal of end-to-end exception analysis is to easily and efficiently identify the most frequenterrors and the applications that are causing them.Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 1/2Using End-to-End Exception Analysis (EA) 2/2The figure, End-to-End Exception Analysis - Overview, shows the entry screen with feature descriptions. Here, you get a good overview of the exceptions in your solution for the chosen time frame.The ABAP SysLog Errors view is divided into different sections:Overall Result: The upper section displays a summary across all ABAP instances belonging to the selected system. You can drill down into the view by right-clicking.Select Instance: The lower section contains instance specific data. You can select individual instances with the dropdown list.Metric Data Display: The Jump-In feature is only available for the instance specific view. In this case, you can jump into transaction SM21 for further analysis. The following table shows all Jump-In functionalities, sorted by exception class.The goal of E2E change analysis is to provide a top-down view of the configuration parametersand software (configuration items) changes of the managed systems.Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 1/2Using End-to-End Change Analysis (CA) 2/2The change analysis opens an Overview tab, and an additional tab is created for each product instance of the selected system(s) and for the hosts.The most common use case of the trace analysis tools is to identify user requests within a complex system landscape that have an excessive execution time.It includes analysis features across the complete solution landscape, so that a component causing a problem can be isolated and the root cause can be identified.Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 1/2Using End-to-End Trace Analysis (TA) 2/2If you want to enable a trace you first need to select the system, you want to trace for. To do this, use the Scope icon. Select all systems you want to trace, then choose Ok. Select the Trace Enabling viewChoose Enable all. The State icon indicates if the trace could be successfully enabled. DEMORoot Cause AnalysisSystem Analysis:\\xa0In case of non-ABAP based systems, the CA transaction trace can be used to identify which part of a request e.g., in a Java environment caused the problem. CA Introscope is shipped by SAP with preconfigured dash boards, offering dedicated views for the ABAP and non-ABAP based systems. A deep analysis of problems is possible in the investigator mode, which displays detailed performance metrics. Several other system analysis tools as Thread Dump Analysis, Change Reporting and Central Log Viewer are provided.Configuration Validation:\\xa0Configuration validation determines whether the systems in your landscape are configured consistently and in accordance with your company\\'s requirements. You validate the current configuration of a system in your SAP landscape by comparing it with a target state (system) or an existing system.Host Analysis:\\xa0With the Host Analysis section of the RCA Work Center, it is possible to analyze the most important OS metrics like CPU, memory, paging, network and disk/file system. In addition, the file system browser allows a central read-only access to predefined directories on the managed system without having to logon to the console of the managed system. In the same manner it is also possible with the OS Command Console, to execute predefined, non-destructible commands (like a ping, netstat, iostat and so on). Both tools ensure that even whilst access to the managed system is granted, no change can be made, no business data can be accessed, and not harmful commands can be executed.Database Analysis:\\xa0The DB Analysis summarizes DB Performance Warehouse specific metrics across all supported DB types. This also includes standalone DB\\'s that are connected to the DBA Cockpit within Solution ManagerAppendixBusiness Process OperationsBusiness Process ImprovementAgendaSAP Business Process Operations comprises the most important application-related operations topics to ensure the smooth and reliable flow of the core business processes, to meet a company’s business requirements.

For example, information about the current and historical values of technical configuration parameters, transport requests, or software maintenance activities can be provided from monitored systems.Change reporting can be accessed from the Root Cause Analysis work center via System Analysis.The change reporting function is the end-to-end solution operation standard to analyze, compare, and track changes in the software landscape.This ensures that all software changes remain transparent and traceable, which in turn increases the quality and availability of the software landscape.Change ReportingThe change analysis function provides an overview of the changes that have been applied to the managed systems and their product instances. You can access it from the Root Cause Analysis Group.Change analysis helps you to keep track of the changes in your solution landscape. Your development system might behave differently than your production system. Therefore, regular snapshots of the configuration settings are taken and stored. With this information, the change analysis function enables you to identify the changes. The change analysis function provides the number of changes details and history of a changed item.Change Analysis / Product InstanceThe change analysis function provides an overview of the changes that have been applied to the managed systems. It also displays the number of changes per system, change category, and day.You can access it from the Root Cause Analysis Group. It reports changes of configuration items of a system (for example, OS, DB, ABAP parameters, Java parameters, transport requests, and Support Packages) and serves as a central entry point for root cause analysis.Change Analysis / SystemsConfiguration Validation in SAP Solution Manager enables you to determine whether the systems in your landscape are configured consistently and in accordance with your requirements.

An administrator can assign an authorization area to a folder. Then only users that have an authorization for authorization object Solution Documentation (SM_SDOC) with this authorization area name in the field Authorization Area (SMUDAREA) for this authorization area are allowed to perform activities for this folder and its sub elements.Authorization areas are defined solution-specific. An authorization area has a 30 character long technical name and a description. The default authorization area does not need to be defined. The Solution Documentation root element and all elements without assignment have the implicit authorization area assignment Default by definition.When no authorization areas have been assigned to the elements of a solution yet, every element has authorization area Default. The assignment of a structure element to an authorization area is valid for all branches of a solution in which the assigned elements exists. The authorization area explicitly assigned to a structure element is valid for the whole subtree rooted by the element excluding all subtrees rooted by elements with own authorization area assignments. Non-structure elements always inherit the authorization area from their structure parents. The authorization area determination is branch-specific as the inheritance hierarchy is branch specific: if an element is moved between two folders that have different areas assigned, it may inherit a new authorization area from the new parent folder, so in this case the authorization area of an element may differ in different branches.Authorization AreaToday in Jera Solution Documentation two SAP Best Practices uploaded as below:SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA (on promise) (S4HANA2020 - JP)SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA (on promise) (S4HANA2020 - US)The idea is to segregate the access to each Solution documentation between JAM users and JAPAN users.To do that the authorization Object SM_SDOC is used, value Authorization Area.Jera ScenarioCreate 2 Authorization Area as below:BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JAMBP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JAPANCreate 2 new roles copy of SAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY --> For DisplayZSAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY_US (SM_SDOC : Authorization Area = BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_US)ZSAP_SM_SL_DISPLAY_JP\\xa0\\xa0(SM_SDOC : Authorization Area = BP_SCENARIO_S4HANA_JP)Do the same for below roles:SAP_SM_SL_ADMINSAP_SM_SL_EDITSAP_SM_SL_EDIT_BPMNApproachCreate 2 new roles copy of ZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP --> For DeveloperZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP_US (include new single roles *US)ZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMP_JP  (include new single roles *JP)Do the same for above composite roles.ZSAP_OST_FB_ARCHITECT_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_BPE_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_OWNER_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_PM_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_ARCH_UAT_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_CHANGE_M_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_CHANGE_R_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_DEV_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_REL_M_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_TESTER_COMPZSAP_OST_FB_TEST_M_COMPAssign new composite roles to user instead of current assigned roles.ApproachFor users with *JP roles the result in Soldoc will be as below:ResultFor users with *US roles the result in Soldoc will be as below:ResultApplication OperationsUser Experience MonitoringAgendaThe analysis of performance and functional problems in such a complex landscape is time consuming and requires expert knowledge. The end-to-end cross-component tracing aims to decrease the time for gathering the relevant trace data related to a single user activity and simplifies the analysis by guiding the user through the analysis steps and identifying the component which consumes the biggest amount of the total execution time. In addition, it is possible to find exceptions which were triggered by the request in one of the connected components.OverviewAfter the trace has been created, SAP Solution Manager collects all the trace data from all systems and displays the results broken down per step in an overview screen.User experience monitoring setup consists of three technical steps:PreparationRecording the script (Http/Https or GUI Scripts)Deploying the script on robots (Diagnostic Agent)Data CollectionSetup GuidePreparation:Perform Solution Manager mandatory configurationIdentify scenarios for scriptingIdentify diagnostic agents at global locations to be used as robotsIdentify monitoring parameters and thresholds for alerting123Specify exact end user scenario to be scripted: The user scenario documentation is one of the most important steps during  an EEMon Project. It should be regarded as roll-in process where the business users explain a user scenario in detail and provide a well-defined click-sequence through the relevant scenarios.To avoid unnecessary complexity in the scenarios the documentation step should be performed together with Application Operations team to reflect EEMon limitations and opportunities. Document all end user scenarios in detail, which means a stranger should be able to reproduce it.Prepare screenshots for every transaction stepNote down every value used in input fieldsNote down every mouse clickNote down indicators for a successful execution for each stepWhat protocol technology is used?

Available information about custom code lifecycle management such as usage or similarity supports you to decide if custom code objects can be retired from the system.Custom Code ManagementDemoCustom Code ManagementBusiness Process OperationsData Consistency ManagementAgendaSAP Business Process Operations comprises the most important application-related operations topics to ensure the smooth and reliable flow of the core business processes, to meet a company’s business requirements. SAP Business Process Operations comprises the following processes: Business process monitoring Business process improvementJob management and job monitoringData consistency managementBusiness Process OperationsData Consistency Management in Solution Manager comprises the tools and procedures required to prevent, detect, investigate and correct inconsistencies in your solution landscape. This helps to ensure the successful execution of your core business processes and prevents costly business process downtimes.Today\\'s business processes evolve in complex structures involving several systems of the overall landscape. As shown in the picture below it is important to ensure the data consistency between all involved systems.Data Consistency ManagementOverview & MotivationApart from user level errors like an incorrect manual entry in the system, there are possibilities of inconsistencies as well on application and technology level. The next slide presents potential causes of data inconsistency.Is the data exchanged between the systems as well as the data needed for correct operation of the business process consistent?Data Consistency ManagementWhy can Data Inconsistencies Occur?ExamplesDatabase Crash at a customer and last backup ~12 months old. Which business documents/areas are affected?Inconsistencies between MM and FI during goods movements with unknown Root Cause. What is the root cause?A custom-made report has accidentally deleted parts of business objects. Which objects are affected?Some data has been replicated multiple times between two systemsInconsistent data storage in multiple systems using sRFC/HTTP within one business step. What data arrived where?Many IDoc errors between ECC and WM. Is there an interface error that affects my most important business partner?Data Consistency ManagementWhy can Data Inconsistencies Occur?Global transparency across organizational units & process variants through increase visibility of current data quality and consistency state.Reduced operating costs through automating data consistency management and reduce manual process inefficiencies and human errors. Avoid systematic process exceptions.Higher customer satisfaction & faster revenue stream by avoiding delayed business documents and financial losses by quick reaction to interface errors affecting data of core business processes.More accurate business reporting by avoiding inaccurate reporting data by ensuring consistency between systems and quicker clean up due to earlier detectionData Consistency ManagementBenefitsSolution Manager includes several tools to cover the Data Consistency Management cycle and different technologies.Data Consistency ManagementToolsData Consistency ManagementData Consistency Management Launchpad GroupData Consistency ManagementData Consistency Management Launchpad GroupDEMOData Consistency ManagementApplication OperationsIntegration MonitoringAgendaIntegration Monitoring focuses on monitoring of communications between business-critical systems within the on-premise landscape at customer side as well as on communications with business partners and SAP cloud products.It covers peer-to-peer communications, communications via integration components as well as the status of the SAP based integration components itself in terms of availability, performance and exceptions.OverviewAll systems are connected to SAP Solution Manager and system monitoring is enabled Configuration of Integration Monitoring is supported by guided procedures Results are collected centrally in SAP Solution ManagerMonitoring StrategyPossibility to check the overall status of multiple PI Domains in one screenCentral status monitoring for all PI component Monitoring of PI Message Flows down to single instancesVisualization of different interface types including sufficient monitoring and alerting for performance, usage, availability and exceptions As a part of Integration Monitoring, Interface and Connection Monitoring (ICMon) in SAP Solution Manager provides you with a powerful tool to monitor various interface technologies within your landscape.To use Interface Monitoring, connect to Solution Manager Launchpad > Group “System and Application Monitoring” > Tile “Interface Monitoring”Interface & Connection MonitoringInterface & Connection Monitoring1234Click Go to see available technical scenariosActivate technical scenario checkboxClick OkInterface & Connection MonitoringThe infrastructure configuration must be done whenever you want to use interface and connection monitoring. It can only be accessed via transaction SOLMAN_SETUP --> Application Operations --> Integration Monitoring --> Interfaces and Connections. The Setup itself consists of several steps which are executed as a Guided Procedure. Each step contains a help section as well as a logging area.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureSeveral Configuration Steps are necessary in order to prepare the Monitoring and Alerting Infrastructure. Most of these steps are common for all Monitoring use cases.Standard Users (optional):In this optional step, you can create the standard Level 1 and Level 2 Interface and Connection Monitoring Template/Demo Users in the SAP Solution Manager system. When you create a template user, the system assigns roles and authorizations automatically.The level 1 user can distribute problems in the Alert Inbox, to other users. Besides the ICMon UI he can access the Alert overview monitor and can create notifications/incidents.The level 2 user has all authorization of the level 1 user plus additional permissions to act as the second level support for certain problems. He can work in the Alert Inbox and performance Root Cause Analysis activities in order to process relevant problems.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureDefine Scope:The first step in the interface channel monitoring setup with Interface and Connection Monitoring is the creation of an Interface and Connection Monitoring scenario. Without selecting a scenario, you cannot proceed to the next setup steps. A scenario is a set of technical systems and/or hosts.Monitoring & Alerting Setup:Preparation:Select Scenario Attributes (Optional)In order to tag an Interface Channel, so-called Interface Channel Attributes can be used. These tags can be used to assign e.g. business process information to the channel, to make it easier to understand the impact of a technical interface channel to business.Click on the ICMON Attribute Assignment linkSelect the attributes you want to use for this scenario or create new onesSave your work Activate Web Service Monitoring (Optional)If you want to monitor synchronous web service calls regarding performance and number of executions of your ABAP system, you first need to activate local Web Service Monitoring in the managed system.EEM Script ConfigurationYou can create UXMon (User Experience Monitoring) scripts to monitor the availability of your interfaces with synthetic load.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureActivate SAP MII MonitoringIf you have an SAP MII (Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence) in your landscape, you can use Interface and Connection Monitoring to monitor the SAP MII data servers.Schedule ExtractorsIn this activity extractors are scheduled which are relevant for collecting the information from the managed ABAP system. You can find these extractors in the EFWK under the setup type IC_MON.Load ST-A/PI Meta Data from Managed SystemSome of the data collectors we use for interface monitoring on the ABAP system are historically shipped with ST-A/PI and their availability depends on the ST-A/PI version installed on the managed system. To know which monitors are available for each managed ABAP system you need to download the meta data information for the monitors from the ABAP system.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureConfiguration:In the next step you can now either create a new Interface Channel, or you can assign or copy an existing one. You can also delete or un-assign channels.Assign existing Channels:If you want to assign an already existing channel to your scenario switch to the view \"All relevant channels\" and all available channels will appear. Select the channel you want to assign and click the \"Assign\" button. You don\\'t have to change anything in the channel.Create a new Channel:To create a new Interface Channel, click the \"Create\" button. In the emerging window you now enter the channel name, the channel type and select a monitoring template depending on the type. In the next step you enter the source and the target system. If your source/target system is a technical system or an external service in the landscape added to this scenario, then you can select it from the drop-down list.If you have selected a channel type that can be measured in source or target system, and you have selected source and target systems that both support the measurement (e.g. both ABAP systems for IDoc channels) you can also select the measuring point in this step.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureActivation:Once you have set all thresholds and data collection period you can activate the interface monitoring. You have different options to activate the interfaces.All Interface ChannelsSelected Interface Channels onlyAll changed Interface channelsSelected Interface Channels (in Dialog Mode) Select the one that suits you best.The activation takes place in a background job, except you select the dialog mode activation. A progress bar shows the status of the background job.Deactivation:If necessary, you can also deactivate all or single interfaces.Configure Monitoring InfrastructureDEMOIntegration MonitoringApplication OperationsIntegration MonitoringAgendaIntegration Monitoring focuses on monitoring of communications between business-critical systems within the on-premise landscape at customer side as well as on communications with business partners and SAP cloud products.It covers peer-to-peer communications, communications via integration components as well as the status of the SAP based integration components itself in terms of availability, performance and exceptions.OverviewAll systems are connected to SAP Solution Manager and system monitoring is enabled Configuration of Integration Monitoring is supported by guided procedures Results are collected centrally in SAP Solution ManagerMonitoring StrategyPossibility to check the overall status of multiple PI Domains in one screenCentral status monitoring for all PI component Monitoring of PI Message Flows down to single instancesVisualization of different interface types including sufficient monitoring and alerting for performance, usage, availability and exceptions As a part of Integration Monitoring, Interface and Connection Monitoring (ICMon) in SAP Solution Manager provides you with a powerful tool to monitor various interface technologies within your landscape.To use Interface Monitoring, connect to Solution Manager Launchpad > Group “System and Application Monitoring” > Tile “Interface Monitoring”Interface & Connection MonitoringInterface & Connection Monitoring1234Click Go to see available technical scenariosActivate technical scenario checkboxClick OkInterface & Connection MonitoringThe infrastructure configuration must be done whenever you want to use interface and connection monitoring.
